# Project Ideas Python
COMPUTER. Com-pu-ter! Pretty much that's the biggest revolution that has ever happened in the human world done by, of course, the humans! They are the man-made brain with customized memory, a different array of electronic materials, and yeah, with more of human intelligence. With that being said, Computer Science is one of the happening fields in engineering and with a lot of scope in future. Well, if you are a rookie in this field and feel like lost in a dense forest, worry not, I am just here to help you with the survival, with the benefit of the density of the prosperous forest that you accidentally stepped in for good. Pardon me for the cheesy intro, trust me you won't regret it.

- Python is the programming language of the future. It is one of the most popular, powerful and easy programming languages. Python has vast applications in almost every area. Python is used in many final year engineering projects. It is applicable in web development, software development, mathematics to system scripting. Python is used as the main source for final year engineering projects. In this repo, you will get to know everything from basic to advanced use of Python programming and some python final year projects. Python programming serves as a boon to computer science engineers and electronics engineers. If you are a student from any of these branches then you are at the right place and reading the right stuff.
