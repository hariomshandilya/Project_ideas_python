# Project Ideas Python
COMPUTER. Com-pu-ter! Pretty much that's the biggest revolution that has ever happened in the human world done by, of course, the humans! They are the man-made brain with customized memory, a different array of electronic materials, and yeah, with more of human intelligence. With that being said, Computer Science is one of the happening fields in engineering and with a lot of scope in future. Well, if you are a rookie in this field and feel like lost in a dense forest, worry not, I am just here to help you with the survival, with the benefit of the density of the prosperous forest that you accidentally stepped in for good. Pardon me for the cheesy intro, trust me you won't regret it.

- Python is the programming language of the future. It is one of the most popular, powerful and easy programming languages. Python has vast applications in almost every area. Python is used in many final year engineering projects. It is applicable in web development, software development, mathematics to system scripting. Python is used as the main source for final year engineering projects. In this repo, you will get to know everything from basic to advanced use of Python programming and some python final year projects. Python programming serves as a boon to computer science engineers and electronics engineers. If you are a student from any of these branches then you are at the right place and reading the right stuff.

# Why python?
You may have a question popping up in your minds by now, i.e., Why Python only? You will get it better by these points listed below:

- Python is a programming language that is very easy to understand and grasp.
- It uses a simple syntax very like our spoken English
- Python goes well with almost every platform
- Python can be used to handle big data
- Used in complex mathematics
- Python always cut shorts the lengthy codes in other programming languages.
- Python has also many different versions. The latest version being Python 3.

- What is python used for?
Python with its amazing capabilities has many vast uses and applications in almost every field. Among some are it can be used to create web applications using a server. Python can also be used to develop software. Python has an essential application in database systems. It can be used to create, read and change files. Python can also be used for prototyping and complex software development with easy programs. Python is also used in machine learning.


# What are the advantages of using python?
Python has diverse applications as a result of its wonderful combination of features like:

Support Libraries: Python provides a range of standard libraries ranging from libraries which include fields of internet protocols, web services, operating system interfaces, and many others.

Open Source: Python is available as an open-source platform. It is updated and developed by the host of programmers by introducing several modules.

Easy learning and access to Support facility: Python serves as an amazing and easy to understand programming language for beginners because of its similarity with the normal English language which we use. Python serves excellent readability. Since this language has emerged as the fastest-growing programming language of this era, it has varied support available over the internet. Along with the rich internet source bank, its problems can be easily solved whenever the programmer gets stuck.

User-friendly Data Structures: Python supports the built-in list and dictionary data structures. Through these libraries, the length of code can be reduced using high-level dynamic programming.

Speed: Python with its object-oriented design structure and control capabilities has very high-speed execution. The short length codes also increase the speed of programming.
Embeddable: Python is embeddable that is we can put the same Python code in C or C ++ and add other scripting capabilities.

IoT Capabilities: Python serves as a major source of coding in ML and Raspberry Pi Projects. It is playing a major role in making things smarter.
